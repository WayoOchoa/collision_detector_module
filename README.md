# Collision Detection and Avoidance for AUV
Library that implements functions for risk assessment of obstacles (in the form of a 3D point cloud) in underwater environments. In contains the necessary functions for feature detection, feature matching, 3D points triangulation, and risk assessment; based on our paper [Collision Detection and Avoidance for Underwater Vehicles Using Omnidirectional Vision](https://doi.org/10.3390/s22145354).

## Installation
The library was implemented in Ubuntu 18.04 and using ROS melodic. Ro build the project the following dependencies are also required:
